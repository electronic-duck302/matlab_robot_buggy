Introduction
----------
This lab was originally introduced to give 1st year students a taste of how to use computers to control hardware and how to make computers interact with the real world (See figure 1).  Unfortunately, between March 2019 and now, there was a global pandemic, this makes it hard to run large group labs with 300+ students in them.  Added to this the robots are fairly complicated devices lots of wires which would be very hard to clean.  I therefore had to come up with a virtual buggy lab which gives you most of the experience of the real lab but in a safe (and hopefully fun!) way.  The answer is the virtual buggy lab:  I have written a buggy simulator and a virtual environment which which enables you to simulate the actions of the buggy in matlab.  The only thing you will miss out on is the actual screwing together of the buggy, which is a real shame but was more a fun exercise rather than anything where you learnt a great deal.

The buggy emulator
------------------

In the real world you often need to write [emulators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator), so simulate a piece of equipment or computer system.  You may have to do this because ;1) the real equipment is not yet developed think of writing code for a new mobile phone chip which has not yet been fabricated ;2) the equipment is [too old so does not exist any more](http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/nes/) such as a Nintendo emulator to run your old sonic the hedgehog games; 3) Or because testing your device out in the real world is too expensive.  An example of the latter is in developing automated driving systems.  It's far quicker (and safer!) to test your new machine learning algorithms out on a virtual world than let them drive around a real car.  Usually, one uses an emulator to develop the code for a product, then moves onto the real hardware one available.  In our scenario, it's just all too dangerous to run the lab as usual.
