An Octave/MATLAB powered Raspberry PI robot buggy
=================================================

This repository contains all the source code and teaching material needed to build and construct an octave/MATLAB powered Raspberry PI robot buggy with acoustic sensors for distance sensing and a camera for object detection.  It runs off 9 AA cells, has a built in voltage regulator and a 3D printed camera bracket.

- *Work sheet 1* : Building the buggy
- *Work sheet 2* : Introduction to Octave on the PI
- *Work sheet 3* : Output, controlling the motors and LEDs
- *Work sheet 4* : Input, echo sensors, switches and cameras.
- *Work sheet 5* : Image recognition
- *Work sheet 6* : The buggy challenge, an obstetrical course for the buggies.
- *buggy_simulator* : A virtual buggy simulator for when we can't do the lab. Works a bit like LOGO on the BBC micro.

Time taken to build/do the work sheets
--------------------------------------

This project is meant to take 1st year mechanical engineering undergraduate students 4x4hr sessions over 4 weeks.
